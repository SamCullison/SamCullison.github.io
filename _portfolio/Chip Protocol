With instruction from Dr. Brain O'Grady I created my PDMS hydrogel in September 2023. To take this product further the hydrogel was plasma bonded to a glass slide, resulting in the 
creation of a microfluidic device. This protocol assumes that a mold has already been created and that the correct materials and equipment have been acquired. 

Following this protocol has allowed me to create over 25 microfluidic chips with high success. The link to the PDF follows
