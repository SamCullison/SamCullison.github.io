# About the Project 
This synthesis was a part of my Organic Chemistry II course my freshman year. We were to pick a molecule that interested us, and create a synthesis route which was not 
currently used. I chose fentanyl because of its recent publicity with the opoid epidemic, and because of its large use in hospitals. Creating this synthesis was challenging, but I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of having an end goal with limited restrictions and endless reactions to choose from. This synthesis was to be used by graduate students or seniors in their capstone projects (and they would make a fentanyl derivative of course).
