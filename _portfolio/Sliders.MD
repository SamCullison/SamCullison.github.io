# Origin of the Sliders Project

The sliders project began after I rewatched Iron Man and saw Tony Stark's Arc Reactor. I thought the design would look great as an aluminum object and I set 
about creating the CAD and CAM to manufacture it with the CNC. However, this proved to be easier than I imagined and I decided to change gears and instead create two pieces which would fit together and spin against one another. As you see in the CAD below, one sliders positive ridge/ring correlates to a negative on the other. The tolerances were also adjusted to ensure that the pieces could slide with limited friction from the walls.

# Difficulites in Machining

The cylinder base of the slider also proved to be difficult to machine with out current equipment. The arc did not provide a sufficient base for the mighty jaws, which I learned the hard way. In the future this design will be changed to have a sort of X that spans both cylindrical bases, as to provide a solid, straight surface for clamping. 

Althought the end product from the intial run is not what I wanted, I am happy with the finish of the top being much better than those of my "custom cubes". Instead of facing off only with the 4 flute 3/8 end mill, a separate toolpath was generated to achieve a cleaner finish. This path used a 7 flute 3/8 square end mill at a lower feed rate and will be used in future projects.
