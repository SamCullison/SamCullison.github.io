# Project Purpose
This device was created to increase the success of embedding neurovascular tissue into microfluidic devices. If the embedding is not done correctly then the tissue is wasted and less experiments can be excecuted. A failure can occur for a variety of reasons but its essentially when the fluid being dispensed from the pipette does not travel stright down the main channel in the chip. It instead projects outwards into side channels which leads to the main channel being incompletely filled and thus not usable. With my device, the chip is held firmly at the correct angle to prevent any erroneous flow. Additionally, the researchers who are embedding (myself and my mentor) only have to hold the pipette, as opposed to before where the pipette and device were each held in a hand. This decreases the error attributed to small hand jerks which can lead to plunging the pipette too deep or too short. 

# Creation of the Device
The CAD for the chip holder was designed using Fusion 360. Subsequently after, it was printed using preform and an SLS printer that is housed in lab. This was my first time 3D printing and it was more straighforward than I anticipated. The device and each strap were printed at the same time and took 6 hours to finish. 
Although everything printed and worked with the first iteration, more steps were taken with the actual design of the product. Specifically, 2 prior designs were generated before my mentor and myself were satisfied. The first and second CAD iterations follow.
