# Project Purpose 
This project was tasked to me by my Post Doc mentor in order to show the manufacturing ability of the CNC. Each set of plates can be used in an extrusion moulder, leading to rapid production of the chosen microfluidic device. In this case, the chosen device was a diffusion gradient generator. We will use this in the future to conduct tests in which brain organoids or stem cells are embedded into the wells at the bottom of the device. These cultures can then be exposed to varying gradients of growth factors or other bioactive molecules, thus provoking a unique reaction from each indivisual well. 

This project required a lot of work, but I really enjoyed creating something that serves an important purpose for my lab.

# Creation of the Sketch
Although the sketch is not extremely complicated, its size caused my computer to crash many times towards the end. Eventually I learned to only use constraints when they were absolutely needed, and this greatly reduced my computers work. Doing this also fixed many errors and discontinuities that were occuring when Fusion rendered the sketch. Another way I saved time was through a workflow that was recommended to me. Instead of completing the sketch from top to bottom, I made a single channel from each row (picture seen below). I was then able to pattern these across and subsequently attach them together with lines that would form the center channels and junctions.

The sketch produced at the end is seen below.

# Adding the Microfluidic Sketch to the Plate Templates
Once the channels were created it was straightforward adding them to the templates for the extrusion moulder.
