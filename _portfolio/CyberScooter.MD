During my winter break in 2022 I decided to start a blog. This blog would encapsulate my interests and I would write about topics I've been yearning to learn more about. Not only did I find writing the articles enjoyable, I also found that it improved my retention of the material. Instead of passively watching or reading about the material I was creating my own "review" and I had to formulate my own conclusions. 

Picking topics to write about also further cemented my curiosity for pharmaceuticals. I loved writing about anesthetics (which led to me shadowing an anesthesiologist) and the COVID vaccines, and this is when I really knew that I wanted to be involved with these compounds after gradutation.

While school and my internship got in the way of my production of articles. I look forward to exploring my growing bank of questions come this Summer.
