## Education

Sam Cullison is a chemical engineering graduate with a focus in biotechnology and business. Graduating magna cum laude with a GPA of 3.94, academic excellence was consistently shown across courses in college, and leadership was demonstrated in club leadership and engineering group projects. Sam's passion for biology is evident in his coursework in immunoengineering, synthetic biology, biomaterials for drug delivery, and biochemistry. Macroeconomics, corporate strategy, and business management classes were also taken, for interests sake, and showed Sam the engaging nature of breaking down big problems and solving organizational challenges. Overall, school was extremely rewarding and Sam intends to continue to learn at the same pace despite the end of formal lectures and classwork.

## Experience 

### Product Solutions Engineer, Procter & Gamble — Mason, OH (May 2025 – Present)
Sam supports P&G’s External Supply Solutions team in Oral Care, partnering with manufacturing, packaging, and process-engineering to optimize production lines, troubleshoot package-to-process handoffs, and drive continuous-improvement projects. He leverages his hands-on fabrication background and cross-functional communication skills to deliver scalable, cost-effective solutions.

### Process Engineering Intern, Evonik — Janesville, WI (May 2024 – Aug 2024)
At a global specialty-chemicals plant, Sam led the integration of heat-trace lines into the DCS, coordinated Management of Change (MOC) and alarm rationalization, and audited valve fail-states to update E-Stop procedures. He delivered a DOE-centered sustainability proposal to North America leadership—paving the way for the site’s participation in the U.S. DOE Better Plants program.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Vanderbilt University — Neurovascular Tissue Engineering Laboratory (Sep 2022 – May 2024)
In a bioengineering research lab, Sam designed and machined PDMS microfluidic chips (Fusion 360, CNC, SLA printing), assembled a Raspberry Pi-controlled peristaltic pump, and embedded neurovascular tissue in the laboratory. His efforts aimed to simulate neurovascular function with the creation of an organ-on-a-chip
technology capable of mimicking blood-brain barrier activity. 

### Competitive Intelligence Marketing Intern, Trax Retail — Denver, CO (May 2022 – Aug 2022)
Sam conducted 20+ interviews with sales and product-development teams across 12 countries to map the competitive retail-analytics landscape. He delivered regional intelligence datasheets, a onboarding intelligence framework, and an executive-level PowerPoint deck which was presented on Wall Street.
